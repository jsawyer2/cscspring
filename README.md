Computational humanities spring 2019

This repo contains a HTML version of my text, with previous and next links that redirect you to the last chapter and the next chapter.

It also contains a .CEX version of my text, which is more difficult than the HTML to read but is still legible.

It also contains my reflective essay about what we covered this year in computational humanities.
